# Grad-CAM on MIMIC Subset for AI Demographic detection

### Overview

This project applies Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) on a subset of the MIMIC dataset to visualize and interpret the regions of medical images that a deep learning model focuses on while making predictions. The goal is to assess the correlation between the model's attention and clinically relevant areas in the images.
